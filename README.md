# Crystal Game

 A simple game utilizing on click functions and RNG capabilities.
 
 When the user begins the game each image is assigned a random value, and the user is given a random value between between 1 and 100 as their target. 
 By clicking the images the random number that is assigned will be added to their score. If their score matches the target number and their win counter goes up by one. If a click causes the score to go above the target number, the user loss counter goes up and the game is reset. 
 
 The game is powered by Javascript, HTML and CSS
